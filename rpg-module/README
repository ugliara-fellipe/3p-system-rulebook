The rpg_module class is inspired by the old-school Dungeons and Dragons modules
of the 1980s and attempts to recapture the look and feel of those classic
adventures. In the examples directory, you will find several pages from D&D
modules from 1981 which have been typeset with this class and which you can
compare to the original documents.

This package also includes the Basic Stats style, which contains stat blocks
for every monster from the Moldvay/Cook/Marsh Basic/Expert version of the
game. A future version of this class will include monster stats for Advanced
Dungeons & Dragons/OSRIC.


Usage: \documentclass[options]{rpg-module}

See rpg_module.pdf for detailed documentation and a worked example. See
the examples directory for further examples.
